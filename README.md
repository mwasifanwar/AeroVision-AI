### 🧠 How It Works

At its core, the system follows a **modular service-based architecture**, where each component focuses on a distinct responsibility — from frame ingestion to analytics generation.  
This design not only ensures scalability and clarity but also allows developers and researchers to extend or replace modules with minimal effort.

---

### 🔹 **Detailed Data Flow**

1. 🖥️ **Streamlit Frontend (`streamlit_app/app.py`)**  
   Acts as the user interface and control center. Users upload drone footage or images, set detection thresholds, choose watermark preferences, and monitor outputs live.  

2. 🧠 **YOLOv8 Detector (`src/detector.py`)**  
   Processes each incoming frame using **YOLOv8**, performing real-time vehicle detection with high confidence and precision.  
   It outputs bounding boxes, class IDs, and confidence scores for each detected object.

3. 🧭 **Tracker Module (`src/tracker.py`)**  
   Uses an **IOU (Intersection over Union)**-based algorithm to maintain identity consistency across frames.  
   Each car receives a unique tracking ID, ensuring smooth object association even in overlapping or fast-moving scenes.

4. 🎨 **Visualization Engine (`src/viz.py`)**  
   Handles real-time drawing of bounding boxes, track IDs, and overlay elements such as FPS counters and watermark layers.  
   Ensures processed frames are both informative and presentation-ready.

5. 💾 **Export Services**  
   Captures processed frames and writes them as:
   - 🎥 Annotated videos (`.mp4`)
   - 📊 Analytics CSV logs (`.csv`)
   - 🖼️ Snapshots (`.png`)  
   All outputs are stored neatly in the `/outputs` directory, automatically organized by timestamp.

6. 📁 **Reporting & Analysis Layer (`/reports`)**  
   Aggregates key visualizations, architecture references, and summary snapshots that can be used for academic documentation, performance reports, or presentations.

### ⚙️ Architectural Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🧩 **Modularity** | Each function (detection, tracking, visualization) is isolated yet interconnected — easy to extend or upgrade individually. |
| ⚡ **Real-Time Performance** | The entire pipeline is optimized for live frame-by-frame inference without noticeable lag, even on CPUs. |
| 📈 **Traceability** | Every processed frame, detection, and track is stored and can be audited or analyzed later for reproducibility. |
| 💡 **Scalability** | New modules (e.g., multi-class detection, speed estimation) can be integrated with minimal code restructuring. |
| 🧾 **Transparency** | A clear, human-readable code structure allows researchers and developers to easily follow and explain each stage of the process. |

---

In summary, **AeroVision-AI’s architecture** is not just a collection of scripts —  
it’s a **living ecosystem of interconnected components**, purpose-built to bridge drone vision and data science.  
Each frame enters as raw imagery and exits as **interpretable intelligence**, ready for visualization, reporting, or further AI modeling.
